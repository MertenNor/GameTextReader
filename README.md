## 🎮 About
As a person with dyslexia, I wanted a program to read text in video games aloud. However, I could never find a solution that was easy to work with, so I made this program with coding help from AI. I know it's not the best code, but in the end, I got the program to the state I envisioned, and I'm now using it in different games to help me 'read' long dialogues. I'm uploading it here so other people can use it as well.

## 🚀 Features
- **Area Editor**: Add and manage multiple capture areas in one convenient overlay
- **Auto Read & Manual Areas**: Set up areas that read automatically when text is scanned or triggered via hotkey
- **Scan History**: View and replay previous scans with a dedicated history window
- **Controller Support**: Use your game controller to trigger text reading
- **Customizable OCR Settings**: Fine-tune image processing for optimal text recognition
- **Natural Text-to-Speech**: Hear game text read aloud with adjustable voice and speed
- **Layout System**: Save and load your area configurations for different games
- **Freeze Screen**: Pause your screen when selecting areas for easier setup
- **Debug Console**: Monitor the program's operation and view processed images

## ⚙️ Requirements
- [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) must be installed and properly configured on your system.
- Note! When the program opens for the first time, it will guide you through how to install this.
